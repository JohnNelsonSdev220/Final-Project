I am using Tkinter as I said I would in the project launch, because I wanted to clarify to launch the gui.py file to open up my project store page. I am almost done setting up the classes, and for modules 7 and 8, I will be focusing on the cosmetic aspect of the project.
trying to make it look less like a blank window.
